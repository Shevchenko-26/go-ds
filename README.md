## Types of data structures
### Arrays
An array is a data structure that contains fixed-sized collection of elements of same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

Operations on Arrays:
###### Searching
1. Linear Search: A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. 

Worst-case complexity: o(n)

Best-case complexity: o(1)

2. Binary Search: A binary search or half-interval search aims to find the element in a sorted array by first comparing target element with middle element to see whether the element is in first half or second half and keep repeating this until it finds the target element.

Worst-case complexity: o(logn)

Best-case complexity: o(1)
