# Queue
A queue is an ordered list in  which insertions are done at the end(rear) and deletions are done from the begnning(front). The first element to be inserted is the first element to be deleted. Hence it is called First In First Out(FIFO)
In queue, the order in which data arrives is important. It is just like a queue is a line of people waiting to be served in sequential order starting at the beginning of line or sequence.

### Operations
1. Enqueue: When an element is inserted in the queue.
2. Dequeue: When an element is deleted from the queue.

### Applications
**Direct Applications:**
1. Operating systems scheduled jobs (with equal priority) in the order of arrival.
2. Simulation of real world queues, any FIFO served scenario requires a queue. 
3. Multiprogramming
4. Asynchronous data transfer
5. Waiting time of customers at call center
6. Determining no. of cashiers to have at a supermarket.

**Indirect Application:**
1. Auxiliary data structure for algorithms
2. Component of other data structures.
