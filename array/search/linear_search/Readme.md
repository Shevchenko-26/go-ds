# Linear search 
A linear search (or sequential search) is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. 

### Algorithm
1. Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
2. If x matches with an element, return the index.
3. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

### Complexity
Worst-case complexity: o(n)
Best-case complexity: o(1)
